# Fortress: Cryptography & Data Protection

> Part II of The Laravel Fortress — 12 sections · 109 checks
> https://github.com/chuxolab/laravel-fortress/blob/main/parts/02-cryptography-data-protection.md

When writing or reviewing code, enforce these rules.
Check `.fortress.yml` in the project root for overrides.

## Project Awareness

Before enforcing rules, read `composer.json` and `package.json` to detect the project's PHP version,
Laravel version, and installed packages. Skip rules whose conditions don't match the detected stack.

## Rules

### Password Hashing
